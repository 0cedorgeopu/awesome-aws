## What is Nvidia Physx?
 
Nvidia Physx is a software that enhances the physics simulation in games and other applications. It allows for more realistic effects such as explosions, debris, water, cloth, and ragdoll. Nvidia Physx 7 is an older version of Physx that was used by some games released around 2007.
 
## Why do I need to install Nvidia Physx Legacy Driver?
 
If you have a newer version of Nvidia Physx installed on your computer, you may not be able to play Medal of Honor Airborne. This is because the game is incompatible with the newer versions of Physx and needs the older version 7 to work. However, you don't need to uninstall your current version of Physx. You can simply install the Nvidia Physx Legacy Driver, which will add support for older games that use Physx 7 without affecting your current drivers.

2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. Restart your computer if prompted.
4. Launch Medal of Honor Airborne from your library and enjoy the game.

If you still have problems with the game, you can try uninstalling your current version of Physx and installing the one from the game disc. However, this may cause issues with other games that use newer versions of Physx, so it is not recommended.
