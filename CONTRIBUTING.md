# Contributing Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines.

## A Note on Repo AWSomeness

For the initial launch of `awesome-aws`, each repo listed meets at least one of the following criteria:

* Official repo from [aws](https://github.com/aws) or [awslabs](https://github.com/awslabs)
* Community-authored repo with 100+ stars
* Community-vouched repo with < 100 stars

An official repo from [aws](https://github.com/aws) or [awslabs](https://github.com/awslabs) can be removed if the community wishes.

**100+ stars for community repos is not a strict requirement, it only serves as a guide post for the initial compilation.**  If you can vouch for the awesomeness of a repo with < 100 stars and you can explain why it should be listed, please submit a pull request.

Check out the following sections for details on how to add/modify/remove links.

## New Links

* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Add one link per pull request.
* Add the link:
    * `[name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
    * Keep descriptions concise.
    * Maintain alphabetical ordering where applicable.
* Add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* You generally do not need to mention `AWS` or `Amazon Web Services` in the description as it's implied.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.
* Send a pull request with the reason why the addition is awesome.

## Updates to Existing Links or Sections

* Improvements to the existing sections are welcome.
* If you think a listed link is **not** awesome, feel free to submit an issue or pull request to begin the discussion.

Thank you for your suggestions!
